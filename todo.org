* UI
** Menus
*** Organise menus better: algorithms, layout, saving/loading, sharing? 
** Touch events
*** Single-tap should maybe not have any effect, double-tap or hold for creating vertex
*** Hold finger
**** Hold finger on vertex, open menu: delete, make universal, inverse neighbourhood
**** Hold finger elsewhere, open menu: create vertex, insert graphs
*** Pinch
**** Two-finger zoom and rotate
** Workspaces
*** + different layouts, e.g., Graph, Interval, CircularArc, Treedecomposition
** Animation
*** On moving vertex, sending vertex
*** On navigating the workspace
*** Navigating different workspaces
*** On creating vertex, make some kind of visual cue
