* UI
** Menus
*** Organise menus better: algorithms, layout, saving/loading, sharing? 
** Touch events
*** Single-tap should have no effect
*** Touch-hold
**** Hold finger on vertex, open menu: delete, make universal, inverse neighbourhood
**** Hold finger elsewhere, open menu: create vertex, insert graphs

**** Hold finger elsewhere, toggle edit/modelling mode
*** Pinch
**** Two-finger zoom and rotate
** Workspaces
*** + different layouts, e.g., Graph, Interval, CircularArc, Treedecomposition
** Animation
*** On moving vertex, sending vertex
*** On navigating the workspace
*** Navigating different workspaces
*** On creating vertex, make some kind of visual cue
* Modes
** Edit Mode
*** Add/remove vertex/edge
*** Move vertices by touch-holding it, moving it
** Modelling Mode
*** Visualize being in modelling mode by adding shadows (the vertices appear lifted from coordinate system)
*** Much easier movement of vertices, moving sets of vertices
*** Selection of groups of vertices by drawing selection area
